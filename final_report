Final Report: AI Dungeon Master - Consistent World-Building and Adaptive Storytelling
1. Project Overview
This project implements an AI-driven Dungeon Master (DM) for a text-based Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) game. The AI dynamically generates room descriptions, handles encounters, and ensures the game world persists across player sessions. It adheres to simplified D&D mechanics while balancing creative storytelling with consistent state management.

2. Architecture and Design
Overall Structure:

The project is structured into several Python modules to manage specific functionalities:
state_manager.py: Manages game state persistence, including player attributes, NPC status, and inventory.
map_generator.py: Generates the game map and defines logical connections between locations.
description_generator.py: Uses the OpenAI API to generate dynamic descriptions and random encounters.
game_logic.py: Implements the mechanics for combat, skill checks, and item interactions.
main.py: Integrates all modules to manage user interactions and gameplay.
Persistent State:

The game state is stored in a JSON file (game_state.json), ensuring players' progress is saved and restored across sessions.
State components include:
Player attributes: Health, attack power, inventory.
Room states: NPCs defeated, doors unlocked, items collected.
3. Features Implemented
World Memory:

Tracks player actions and updates the state persistently.
Allows revisiting locations with updated descriptions (e.g., defeated NPCs, unlocked doors).
Map Generation and Navigation:

A grid-based map structure with logical connections (north, south, east, west).
Each room has a unique description generated using AI.
Dynamic Descriptions and Interactions:

Uses OpenAI to dynamically create descriptions for rooms and random encounters.
Randomly spawns events like NPCs, treasure chests, and traps.
Simplified D&D Mechanics:

Combat: Players and NPCs roll a virtual 1d6 and add their attack power. Damage is subtracted from HP.
Skill Checks: Players perform skill checks using a 1d10 roll, with difficulty thresholds.
Inventory Management: Players collect and use items such as health potions or keys.
Interactive Gameplay:

Commands include movement (north, south), actions (attack, skill), and saving progress (save).
Players receive immediate feedback based on their inputs.
4. Challenges and Solutions
Challenge: Generating Consistent and Coherent AI Descriptions

Solution: Designed specific prompts for OpenAI API to generate creative yet logical descriptions.
Challenge: Persistent State Management

Solution: Implemented a JSON-based state management system, ensuring continuity across sessions.
Challenge: Logical Map Connections

Solution: Developed a grid-based structure for consistent navigation between locations.
Challenge: Balancing Gameplay Mechanics

Solution: Simplified D&D-inspired mechanics for smooth gameplay while retaining core elements.
5. Results and Demonstration
Gameplay Functionality:

The game successfully generates dynamic room descriptions and interactions.
Persistent state ensures players can resume progress seamlessly.
Demonstration Video:

A recorded gameplay video (video1803670517.mp4) has been uploaded to the GitHub repository.
6. Potential Improvements
Enhanced Features:

Add more NPC types and advanced combat skills.
Implement a text-to-speech (TTS) system for immersive storytelling.
Performance Optimization:

Reduce latency in OpenAI API calls to improve interaction speed.
Refactor code for better modularity and scalability.
